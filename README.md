The following is the privacy policy related to the COVID PASS system, and is applicable to all mobile applications, web, and other channels. If you do not like or agree with this policy, please un-install the COVID PASS application, and stop using the application through the Web and other channels.

We are committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality, and security of your personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). As part of this commitment, our privacy policy governs our actions as they relate to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. Our privacy policy is based upon the values set by the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information and Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

# 1. Introduction

COVID Pass is a system that helps with self-check of COVID symptoms for entry screening, recording keeping of people (staff, customers, visitors, etc.) visiting any establishment as well as contact tracing for COVID-19. This system requires certain information from the users of this system, as indicated in section 2 below.

The establishment could be any private or public sector establishment, any type of business, store, office, educational institution, museum, theatre, or any public space where the government or public health guidelines for COVID-19 apply.

This privacy policy applies to all components of the COVID PASS application that includes Web, Mobile, and IVR components and various user interfaces - the general user interfaces, location interfaces, and the public health user interface.

You may contact us for any questions or concerns regarding the privacy at the email address shown in section 11 below.

This COVID PASS application is a non-profit initiative by the volunteer members of IIT Alumni Canada, and is provided free of cost.

# 2. Identifying Purposes

The system is designed to help establishments to perform screening for COVID-19 symptoms and keeping a record of your visit as required by the local government or public health guidelines. This data helps with contact tracing by the public health agencies.

The system asks you questions about COVID-19 symptoms for the purpose of establishing if you have any COVID-19 related symptoms. You can voluntarily record your visit to any establishment that uses this COVID PASS solution by scanning the QR code. Your visit record will be used for contact tracing purposes.

If you are general public user, this system requires your contact information, that is your email address and optionally your mobile phone number, in order to contact you, if you had potential exposure to a COVID-19 infected person. The system does not need your name or address.

Any specific answers you provide during the COVID-19 symptoms self-check is not stored in the system. We store only the final result of the assessment, which is valid only until 11:59 PM the same day.

If you are an establishment user, we need your name, contact info and location address, in order to contact you for any location-specific purpose.

If you are a public health official, we need your name, contact info, and location address, in order to contact you.

The above information is securely stored in a high-security cloud data centre in Canada, in an encrypted form, and you are allocated a unique randomly generated 12-character token, represented by a QR code. The application does not know who you are. The visit record data contains only this token, and not your actual contact information. Your contact information, your token number, or your visit record data are not shared with anyone, including the public health agencies or any government. It is up to you to provide your personal QR code to any public health agency for contact tracing purposes.

The application does not track your location, does not use GPS or Bluetooth, does not transfer any information from the phone to anyone, and does not access your contacts.

The application does not store anything in the phone or computer’s storage. Any data in the memory will be lost as soon as you log out of the application.

The application does not access or store your IP address.

If you are a general public user, based on the potential exposure notification you receive from the system via e-mail or a text message, you can take necessary steps for consulting your healthcare provider, getting tested for COVID-19, undergo treatment and to isolate yourself to avoid further spreading the virus, in case you got infected.

If you are an establishment contact, we will inform you if there were any people who visited your location and later tested COVID-19 positive, so that you can take any necessary steps to protect your staff and visitors to your location.

If you are a public health official, you can only initiate automated contact tracing if any of the users of this system test positive for COVID-19, without having access to any of the personal data in the system.

All names and contact information are securely stored in an encrypted database.

All tracing data is archived after 28 days. The archived data does not contain any personally identifiable information, and may be allowed to be used by public health researchers in the future.
